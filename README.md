# Shopping cart for a cake shop
Hey! World, let's taste some awesome cakes. So let me give you a cakewalk introduction to this project.
This web application allows users to check for various cakes available at the online store and purchase online. 
The project consists of list of Cakes and bakery products displayed in various categories. 
The user may browse through these items as per categories. If the user likes a product he/she may add it to his shopping cart. 
He may even pay through a credit card or cash on delivery.
Thus the online Cake shopping project brings an entire cake shop online and makes it easy for both buyer and seller.
If you are reading till now it means you already liked this project.
